        <h2>Digital product designer</h2>
      </div>
      <p>I'm a digital designer with a broad insight into the field of web design & development. My insight makes me able to work on a product all the way from the idea & concept developing, to actually design & code the product in collaboration with other team members.</p>
      <p>My biggest motivation for building digital products, is to know that people using it. I love to analyse user behaviour through statistics & user-tests to improve solutions. My background in social science gives me a core understanding of human behaviour and how to make people engage through webdesign.</p>

            <p>Michael was an excellent Prototype Designer, he worked really well in our team and he's very friendly. He could prototype features really quick, so quick that he had time to do some extra prototypes just to try out different scenarios. He's excellent.</p>
