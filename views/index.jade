        h2 Digital product designer
      p I'm a digital designer with a broad insight into the field of web design & development. My insight makes me able to work on a product all the way from the idea & concept developing, to actually design & code the product in collaboration with other team members.
      p My biggest motivation for building digital products, is to know that people using it. I love to analyse user behaviour through statistics & user-tests to improve solutions. My background in social science gives me a core understanding of human behaviour and how to make people engage through webdesign.
